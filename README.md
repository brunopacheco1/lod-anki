## HOWTO

### How to build a deck file?

The deck file is a JSON file, with the following schema:

- name: It is the name of the deck, shown in Anki. It will be concatenated with the language, to avoid duplicity, if you want to export multiple languages;
- fileName: It is the file name. It will be concatenated with the language, to avoid duplicity;
- flashcards: The collection of words in Luxembourgish you want to export;
- languages: The collection of languages you want to export to. The possible values are: ALL (German), EN (English), FR (French), and PO (Portuguese);
- types: The collection of word types you want to export. `lod-anki` will filter the flashcards (or words), and export only the ones matching the types in this list. This field is optional. `noun`, `verb`, `preposition`, `conjunction`, `adjective`, and `adverb` are supported by this tool.

Below you can see an example:

```json
{
    "name": "Greeting in Luxembourgish",
    "fileName": "greeting_in_luxembourgish",
    "flashcards": [
        "Ã„ddi",
        "Awar",
        "Awuer",
        "Bonjour",
        "Moien"
    ],
    "languages": [
        "ALL",
        "EN",
        "FR",
        "PO"
    ]
}
```

When building the deck, put the words in lowercase. But if it is a noun, capitalize the first character, as it is in Luxembourgish.
